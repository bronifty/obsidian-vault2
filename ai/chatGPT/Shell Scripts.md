1. use jq to add a scripts object with the value {"start: "node index"} to package.json

To add a `scripts` object with the value `{"start: "node index"}` to a file called `package.json` using the command line tool `jq`, you can use the following command:

```shell
jq '.scripts = {"start": "node index"}' package.json > temp && mv temp package.json
```


This command uses `jq` to update the `scripts` object in the `package.json` file and save the result to a temporary file. The `mv` command is then used to replace the original `package.json` file with the updated version.

Keep in mind that this command will overwrite any existing `scripts` object in the `package.json` file. If you want to preserve any existing scripts, you can use the `--arg` flag to add the new script without overwriting any existing ones:

Copy code

`jq --arg new_script '{"start": "node index"}' '.scripts += $new_script' package.json > temp && mv temp package.json`

In this case, the `--arg` flag is used to define a new variable called `new_script` which contains the script to be added. The `+=` operator is then used to append the new script to the existing `scripts` object in the `package.json` file.

I hope this helps! Let me know if you have any other questions.
