# Welcome to bro nifty's notes

### Currently studying
- AWS Data (ACG & OMG Adam is streaming)
- Go and k8s infra (Bill)
- Node Streams (Matteo & Erick)
- Fullstack (KCD)

### Projects
- [Mern Stack on Vite hosted by Vercel](http://vite-vercel-opal.vercel.app/ "vite-vercel-opal.vercel.app")
	- This is the only project i finished so far that I'm proud of. It is a refactor of [John Smilga's first project for Node](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rltfdjcXjmk) using HTML CSS and Javascript, which I converted to React on the frontend and ported to serverless functions from standard Express API routes to run on 3 backends: AWS Lambda via the 'serverless framework', Netlify and Vercel. It is a Mongo with Mongoose model based Node and React project with Tanstack Query as the data mechanism.
