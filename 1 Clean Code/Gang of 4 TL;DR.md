Creation
1. Abstract Factory what
2. Builder concrete impl with extra steps
3. Factory Method function extraction
4. Prototype built into js
5. Singleton makes the constructor private with a public method to access the unique instance (see image 1)

Structure (composition)

1. Adapter inject dependency of one class implementation of an interface into another class which implements another interface 
2. Bridge garbage for inheritance; use strategy
3. Composite same as strat but immutable methods in task class (see image 2)
4. **Decorator**: Adds responsibilities to objects dynamically.
5. **Facade**: A single class that represents an entire subsystem.
6. **Flyweight**: A fine-grained instance used for efficient sharing of information that is contained elsewhere.
7. **Proxy**: An object representing another object.

### Behavioral Patterns:

These are specifically concerned with communication between objects.

1. **Chain of Responsibility**: A way of passing a request between a chain of objects.
2. **Command**: Encapsulates a command request as an object.
3. **Interpreter**: A way to include language elements in a program.
4. **Iterator**: Sequentially access the elements of a collection.
5. **Mediator**: Defines simplified communication between classes.
6. **Memento**: Capture and restore an object's internal state.
7. **Observer**: A way of notifying change to a number of classes.
8. **State**: Alter an object's behavior when its state changes.
9. **Strategy**: Encapsulates an algorithm inside a class.
10. **Template Method**: Defer the exact steps of an algorithm to a subclass.
11. **Visitor**: Defines a new operation to a class without change.
