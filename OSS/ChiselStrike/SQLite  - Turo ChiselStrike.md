# ChiselStrike SQLite PG-compat distributed Turo Requirements

Me: 
- Think of me like free labor. if you have anything you want someone low level to do give it to me

GLauber: 
* this shell that you see, we it's a very simple one, cpl of lines of code, just to get the beta going. We want to add a new one, properly, in the libSQL OSS, written in Rust. We'll likely contribute the initial implementation soon, but there will be tons of work to do, like add more commands, etc. The goal is: "if SQLite could have an amazing , 21-century compatible shell, how would it look like?"
- The SQLite folks are surely not even thinking of that
- auto-complete, even crazy stuff like embed GPT, colors, the sky is the limit
* If you love go as you say, we don't have a go driver for the http stuff yet, just ts, ruby, and now rust.
- the goal of our drivers is to always be able to do sqlite locally, and then fallback to http with an env var switch.
