There are 2 Rules for types and their memory assignments in terms of the mechanical sympathy: 

1. the type size has to fall in an alignment that divides it evenly (a 4 byte type cannot fall into a 5 byte space, it must fall into a 4Byte space padded by one Byte before it)

key: 1 Byte = 8 bits
```Go
type example struct {
	counter int16
	pi float32
	flag bool
	bignumba int64
}
```
___________
|  int16  |  float32 | bool | padding | int64 |   
0          2           6        7               8         16
- mechanical sympathy
	- 2 byte vals (eg int16) need to fall in a 2 byte alignment (can start at add 0 or 2)
			- if it starts at an odd number it will cross a machine word boundary and create 2 operations, which is inefficient
	- if it is a 1 byte val (eg bool), it can get padded with a space
	- an 8 byte val (eg int64) needs to start at 0 or 8

key: 1 Byte = 8 bits
int32 must fall on a 4Byte alignment
```Go
type example struct {
	flag bool
	[3]Byte padding
	counter int32
	pi float32
}
```

key: 1 Byte = 8 bits
int64 must fall on an 8Byte alignment
```Go
type example struct {
	flag bool
	[7]Byte padding
	counter int64
	pi float32
	[4]Byte padding
}
```

2. the entire struct has to fall on an alignment equivalent to the largest type (if there is an int64, which is 8Bytes, then a float32, which is 4Bytes, must be padded by 4 to make 8Bytes for each space)
- the derivative rule is that each value's type must consume the same amount of space in the memory as the struct's largest type
	- lesser types must be padded
- in order to maximize efficiency and minimize padding, sort your type declarations by size desc (largest first) so only the last space will require padding
```Go
type example struct {
	counter int64 // 8B
	pi float32 // 4B
	flag bool // 1B
	// [3]B padding
}
```

- Bill just said he doesn't want to see you doing this manually, let a linter do it ... not sure what's the best path then but it's good info anyway

```Go
func main(){
	// Declare a variable of type example
	// set its value to zero (var)
	var e1 example 
	// Display the value
	fmt.Printf("%+v\n", e1)
	// Declare a variable of type example
	// init using a struct literal
	e2 := example {
		flag: true,
		counter: 10,
		pi: 3.141592,
	}
	// Display the field values
	fmt.Println("Flag", e2.flag)
	fmt.Println("Counter", e2.counter)
	fmt.Println("Pi", e2.pi)
}
```

- now let's declare a struct inline
```Go
// Declare a variable of an anonymous type
// set to its zero value
var e1 struct {
	flag bool
	counter int16
	pi float32
}

// Display the value
fmt.Printf("%+v\n", e1)

// Declare a variable of an anonymous type
// and init using a struct literal
e2 := struct {
	flag bool
	counter int16
	pi float32
} {
	flag: true,
	counter: 10,
	pi: 3.14159,
}

// Display the values
fmt.Printf("%+v\n", e2)
fmt.Printf("Flag", e2.flag)
fmt.Println("Counter", e2.counter)
fmt.Println("Pi", e2.pi)
```

- let's show how we cannot assign a variable of one type to the value of another type without an explicit cast
```Go
type bill struct {
	flag bool
	counter int16
	pi float32
}
type nancy struct {
	flag bool
	counter int16
	pi float32
}
var b bill
var n nancy
b = n
fmt.Println(b,n) // can't use n (type nancy) as type bill in assignment 

```

- let's try again with a cast of type 
```Go
type bill struct {
	flag bool
	counter int16
	pi float32
}
type nancy struct {
	flag bool
	counter int16
	pi float32
}
var b bill
var n nancy
b = bill(n) // cast nancy into a bill type
fmt.Println(b,n) 

```

- functions are first class citizens

### Pointers 
- 1 goroutine per hardward thread (1 hardware thread allows 1 kernel thread)
	- Bill's machine is an i7 which has 4 cores, but each core can do 2 threads, so he can run 8 goroutines in parallel
- process attached to machine hardware whose os will will schedule a thread for it to run
- goroutine is an app thread which leverages machine to process instructions sequentially
	- machine then leverages hardware to process the executions
- process > goroutine > machine > os > thread execution
- Every goroutine gets its own contiguous block of memory called a stack (2k default)
	- os thread also gets its own stack, which differs depending on the os type
- main() entrypoint
- when a goroutine executes a function, we consider it crossing a program boundary
	- goroutine executes in frame / sandbox with an allocation of memory; that memory can only be written by that goroutine when it is operating inside that functions program boundary
	- every function is a data transformation; every transformation is input > manipulation > output

- count refers the the value, &count refers to the address
	- combined, it is referred to as the data
```Go
func main(){
	count := 10
	println("count:\tValue Of[", count, "]\tAddr Of[", &count "]")
}
```

- sharing data (the value that the pointer points to not the pointer itself; essentially another pointer to the same value, or a copy of the value which overwrites the previous)
```Go
func main() {
	count := 10
	println("count:\tValue Of[", count, "]\tAddr Of[", &count "]")
	// Pass the "address of" count
	increment(&count)
	println("count:\tValue Of[", count, "]\tAddr Of[", &count "]")
}
// *inc refers to the address of the arg
func increment(int *inc) {
	*inc++
	println("inc:\tValue Of[", inc, "]\tAddr Of[", &inc "]\tValue Points To[", *inc, "]")
}
```

| var   | val | addr | pointer |
| ----- | --- | ---- | ------- |
| count | 10  | 7ac  |         |
| inc   | 7ac | 7a0  | 11      |
| count | 11  | 7ac  |         |


goroutines (more efficient thread call stacks) pass references between functions not as a singular global value, but as temporary addresses which sandbox the transformation before the data is returned to the caller. When functions pass the reference down, a temp address is used and the variable data remains on the goroutine's memory address space. However, if a function needs to pass the reference back up to an earlier function, the variable data 'escapes' the goroutine stack memory & is placed on the heap as a global reference.




### Escape Analysis
```Go
type user struct {
	name string
	email string
}
func main(){
	u1 := createUserV1()
	u2 := createUserV2()
	println("u1", &u1, "u2", u2)
}
func createUserV1() user {
	u := user{
		name: "Bill",
		email: "bill@ardanlabs.com",
	}
	println("V1", &u)
	return u
}
func createUserV2() *user {
	u := user{
		name: "Bill",
		email: "bill@ardanlabs.com",
	}
	println("V2", &u)
	return &u
}
```
- there are no constructors in Go, instead we have factory functions which construct and init a val then return it back to caller

| function | value |
| -------- | ----- |
| main     |       |
| V1       | Bill      |
- v1 uses value semantics
- v2 uses pointer semantics
	- caller gets shared access to the value this function will be constructing, not it's own copy

| function | value |
| -------- | ----- |
| main     |       |
| V2       | Bill  |
|          |       |
- go does static code analysis called escape analysis that determines where your values should go in memory either on stack or heap
- the analysis is how the memory should be shared
- The compiler recognizes that if a value is being shared down, it will be on the stack; if it gets shared up, it will be on the heap as a global
- values only get constructed once; if it gets shared up, it will be escaped from the stack and constructed on the heap
- Garbage Collector manages heap; stack is self-cleaning
- go build -gcflags -m=2
	- gcflags go compiler flags with m2 option
		- compiler will produce escape analysis report (it will not build)
		- we will use this when we are profiling (not when writing code)
		- a profiler can show us what is allocating (on the heap aka 'escaping' the stack), not why; the escape analysis report will tell us why; hint: reason is data sharing up the stack from a main function to another function then back
- we are optimizing for correctness - implying: integrity, readability and simplicity - over performance

escape analysis in golang is slick and it can get confusing, but i think it boils down to: if a function returns a pointer address - aka reference - instead of a copy - aka value - to another calling function, the variable escapes the call stack onto the heap (global scope). cf pass by ref v pass by val; also referred to as 'pointer' v 'value' semantics...

For example: main tells createDog to make a Dog and createDog returns a reference to a pointer's address instead of a copy of the Dog value, which main subsequently utilizes in its calculations, then that Dog variable will escape the goroutine stack (like a thread or thread call stack of function calls and their collective calculations, except virtual with less memory and not directly tied to threads)

- escape command:
```go
go build -gcflags -m=2
```

- OPENAI chatGPT analysis:
	- the command `go build -gcflags -m=2` compiles the Go package in the current directory, and during the compilation process, it generates detailed diagnostic information about inlining and escape analysis at level 2. This information is printed to the terminal.

### Stack Growth
- when the stack grows, it creates a new stack frame of contiguous memory address blocks (rather than appending blocks to the current frame) & moves the values over (basically a copy operation or lift and shift to a bigger, more roomy and luxurious address space)
- no goroutine can share a value with another goroutine on its own stack
	- any pointers in a goroutine are internal
	- if 2 goroutines need to share a value, then lift state up to the global aka heap (which will be checked by the garbage collector loop & removed once there are no more live pointers to it in any running programs)
- Value semantics give us isolation & safe mutations with data locality, but it is inefficient (making copies of stuff), which requires some pointer semantics to keep the complexity down and efficiency up
	- pointer semantics (a reference to a heap variable shared by 2 goroutines) keeps efficiency up and complexity down

```Go
const size = 10
func main(){
	s := "HELLO"
	stackCopy(&s, 0, [size]int{})
}
func stackCopy(s *string, c int, a [size]int){
	println(c, *s, s)
	c++
	if c == 10 {
		return
	}
	stackCopy(s, c, a)
}
```
- "& (ampersand)" and "* (asterisk)" mean heap variable (pointer / reference)
	- & is how you pass in a variable by its address to a function and * is how you accept the variable as an argument in the function definition

- chatGPT
```bash
Q: 
explain this code: func stackCopy(s *string, c int, a [size]int){ println(c, s, *s) c++ if c == 10 { return } stackCopy(s, c, a) }

A: 
This code defines a function named `stackCopy` that takes in three parameters:

-   a pointer to a string
-   an integer value
-   an array of integers with a fixed size

Inside the function, it prints out the values of `c`, `s`, and the string pointed to by `s`. It then increments the value of `c` by 1.

If `c` is equal to 10, the function returns without doing anything else.

If `c` is not equal to 10, the function calls itself recursively, passing in the same values for the three parameters. This recursive call will continue until `c` becomes equal to 10, at which point the function will return and the recursion will end.
----
Q:
what will be the output of this code? const size = 10 func main(){ s := "HELLO" stackCopy(&s, 0, [size]int{}) } func stackCopy(s *string, c int, a [size]int){ println(c, *s, s) c++ if c == 10 { return } stackCopy(s, c, a) }

A:
The code will print out the following 10 lines:

0 HELLO 0x81729c 1 HELLO 0x81729c 2 HELLO 0x81729c 3 HELLO 0x81729c 4 HELLO 0x81729c 5 HELLO 0x81729c 6 HELLO 0x81729c 7 HELLO 0x81729c 8 HELLO 0x81729c 9 HELLO 0x81729c

On each line, the first value is the current value of `c`, the second value is the string pointed to by `s`, and the third value is the memory address where the string is stored.

The recursion will continue until `c` becomes equal to 10, at which point the function will return and the program will terminate.
```

- now let's increase the size of the array from 10 to 1024

```Go
const size = 1024
func main(){
	s := "HELLO"
	stackCopy(&s, 0, [size]int{})
}
func stackCopy(s *string, c int, a [size]int){
	println(c, *s, s)
	c++
	if c == 10 {
		return
	}
	stackCopy(s, c, a)
}
```

- the output will be:
```Go
0 HELLO 0x81729c 
1 HELLO 0x81729c 
2 HELLO 0x81739c 
3 HELLO 0x81739c 
4 HELLO 0x81739c 
5 HELLO 0x81739c 
6 HELLO 0x81749c 
7 HELLO 0x81749c 
8 HELLO 0x81749c 
9 HELLO 0x81749c
```
- we can see the address changes twice (once from 1 to 2 then from 5 to 6) as the stack frame changes to expand to a greater contiguous memory block

### Garbage Collection
- gc sweeps loose references concurrent to goroutine tasks
- pacer figures out when to start collecting and how long it will take 
	- pressure means how quickly we fill the heap up before collecting garbage loose refs
- 4 processors - P - (4 operating system threads - M -) 
	- goroutines run on the processor and thread - G -
- 10-30 µs stop the world time for write locks on (blocked) function calls while gc is running
- 25% of resources are dedicated to gc
- in order to run goroutines concurrently to gc sweeps of loose refs on the heap, one of processors will have to be dedicated to gc and only 3/4 can run goroutines for about 10-300 microseconds (µs) 
- the amount per allocation and total will affect latency of gc which we will look at in the profiling section of the course
	- which lines of code are causing the most allocations on the heap and are there any unproductive lines that are causing unnecessary allocations

### Constants
- like v type (like has higher precision and is promoted to type after the calculation)
- kind only exists at compile time
-
