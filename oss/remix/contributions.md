2.  What are the steps to add an example to remix run examples? I did this: npx create-remix@latest --template examples/_template Added the code to `root.tsx` Added the code to App/routes/index.tsx I created the codesandbox example I modified README.md Why If I need some dependencies I don't need to add it to package.json?

    Add everything needed to run the code. Have a look at how other examples organize and document their code. The framer motion example ([https://github.com/remix-run/examples/tree/main/framer-motion](https://github.com/remix-run/examples/tree/main/framer-motion "https://github.com/remix-run/examples/tree/main/framer-motion")) for instance lists all the required dependencies. ![ðŸ™‚](https://discord.com/assets/da3651e59d6006dfa5fa07ec3102d1f3.svg) And if you haven't already, check out the contributions guidelines: [https://github.com/remix-run/examples/blob/main/CONTRIBUTING.md](https://github.com/remix-run/examples/blob/main/CONTRIBUTING.md "https://github.com/remix-run/examples/blob/main/CONTRIBUTING.md")
