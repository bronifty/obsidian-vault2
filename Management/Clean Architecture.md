	- Context Containers Components Code
		- Scope? all the building blocks on one diagram with connectors
		- Users? rbac
		- What? will they be doing with it
		- SI systems integration requirements
	- prove arch with concrete exs
	- Arch decision record
		- Title LDAP for multitenant integration
		- Context value neutral language describing forces at play "It is..."
		- Decision our response to these forces "We will..."
		- Status proposed accepted rejected in progress complete deprecated etc
		- Consequences resulting context after the decision past is prologue
	- Upfront design is complete when:
		- You understand the arch drivers (requirements, quality attributes - non-functional-design aka implementation details, constraints), context, scope and design decisions (technology, modularity, etc)
		- Your design satisfies the key arch drivers and you have a way to communicate tech vision 
			- test design decisions with arch dry runs, arch evaluations
		- Identified risks (factors which could jeapordize delivery), POCs to de-risk, arch mods to de-risk
		- Techniques: Workshops, Interviews, Event Storming, Impact Mapping, Domain Modeling, OOAD, CRC, DDD, Arch Reviews, ATAM, Arch Dry Runs, Risk Storming, Concrete Experiments, C4 Model, ADRs
