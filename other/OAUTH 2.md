OIDC - authentication
OAUTH2 - authorization (delegated permissions)

OIDC gets an ID token the client app uses to provide experience personalization; OAUTH2 provides an access token attached to outgoing API requests to resource server on user's behalf

Google lib app auth has abstracted the extra steps for auth on mobile

OKTA can be a bridge using SAML and you can just use OIDC/OAuth2 to talk to it
