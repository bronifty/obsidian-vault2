## Fermyon
- Some documentation here to get you started: [https://developer.fermyon.com/spin/rust-components](https://developer.fermyon.com/spin/rust-components "https://developer.fermyon.com/spin/rust-components") 
- For Go, TinyGo needs to be 0.25. 0.26 doesn't work currently: [https://github.com/fermyon/spin/issues/820](https://github.com/fermyon/spin/issues/820 "https://github.com/fermyon/spin/issues/820")

## Hippo
- [hippofactory](https://docs.hippofactory.dev/)
- I really want this to work but it's not (yet); Better to start with Fermyon Cloud Spin which works like a charm; even get to know Rust and Go a little more but can still go for some of these examples
