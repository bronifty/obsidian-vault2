bro nifty birds are not real üê¶ ([@bronifty](https://twitter.com/bronifty)) - November 27, 2022 1:45 AM

Would wiping PATH env var in Mac to start from scratch be equivalent to deleting System32? Has anyone done it? I want to uninstall all npm yarn and brew casks to clean up my system ‚Ä¶

[@bronifty](https://twitter.com/bronifty) Did you install Node and Yarn through Homebrew?

[@bronifty](https://twitter.com/bronifty) I would clear out the npm and yarn directories, reinstall Node through Homebrew, and enable corepack (if you haven‚Äôt already) for Yarn

### Corepack Notes
- [what is corepack fek.io](https://fek.io/blog/what-is-corepack-in-node-js)
```shell
corepack prepare yarn@stable --activate
yarn set version stable
yarn init -2
```
- corepack requires an activation statement like python venv 
- yarn node is the interpreter
	- for example, assuming index.js is the node.js server file: to run node index.js
```shell
yarn node index
```
- dependencies are installed in the .yarn folder of the user directory instead of locally in a node_modules folder and the packages are kept in .zip files like a java archive (jar file)
- to add dependencies, refer to it with corepack prefix like so
```shell
corepack yarn add axios
```

- If you want the node_modules folder (so node will be the interpreter not yarn and you have a direct link to the modules for compatibility), add the following line to .yarnrc.yml:
```yml
nodeLinker: node-modules
```
